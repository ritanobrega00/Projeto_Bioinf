# Projeto_Mtb

This repository contains a bioinformatics pipeline for identifying genetic variants in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb) isolates. The pipeline integrates high-throughput sequencing data retrieval, quality control, read mapping, post-processing, and different variant calling methodologies. It is designed to detect and annotate a wide range of genetic variants, with the aim of correlating these variants with TB disease severity. The repository includes the pipeline code, example datasets, and the wirtten project that gave origin to the pipeline.
