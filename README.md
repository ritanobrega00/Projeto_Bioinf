# Projeto_Mtb

This repository contains a bioinformatics pipeline for identifying genetic variants in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*Mtb*) isolates. The pipeline integrates high-throughput sequencing data retrieval, quality control, read mapping, post-processing, and variant calling methodologies. It is designed to detect and annotate a wide range of genetic variants. The repository includes the pipeline code, example datasets, and the written project that gave origin to the pipeline.
